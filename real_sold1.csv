There is no need to despair, this property package is off the main road and tucked away at the end of its own little cul-de-sac. <br/><br/>Here, you have a very generous 1-acre allotment (approx. 4046m2). As you are the second last house on this quiet no-through street, your views and aspect are literally expansive green paddocks. Enough room for all your pursuits, the yard is fully fenced and pet-proof.<br/><br/>Boats, caravans, vehicles, teenagers and/or the home-based business are catered for here! The 17.5 x 8.5m colorbond shed with 3-metre-high roller doors is absolutely outstanding with its 4 bays plus a separate partitioned workshop area. Here there is a separate bathroom with shower, vanity, storage, and loo. The workshop area boasts a 3.5m work bench, power, and lighting. The 3kw solar system and large poly water tank attached to the shed a clear bonus. If that doesn’t quite cut-it (as if it wouldn’t) we have two shipping containers for ‘extra’ storage with a dome cover for the caravan or boat. <br/><br/>The house is light filled, has been well maintained and recently refurbished. As you enter the house, you are immediately impressed by the polished timber floors that give warmth to the open plan design of living, dining, and grazing (the kitchen is looking awesome with its recent face-lift). <br/><br/>The living area provides a combustion heater to warm the house in Winter and there are fans for the warmer days. This area leads out to the full-length verandah. All three bedrooms are carpeted, have BIR's and the main offers an ensuite for convenience. The main bathroom is a great all-rounder as it is fully equipped. <br/><br/>The extra-large renovated laundry is a feature of the home with modern styling, generous storage space and direct access onto the large covered front deck. The outside area is perfect for relaxing or entertaining friends and family. This is a great and functional space and leads directly to the undercover carport. In addition, there is a freestanding 6 x 3m pergola for more entertaining options, a garden shed and small woodshed. <br/><br/>All this within just a few km to Clarence River (with boat ramp and jetty), the Lawrence Convenience Store (with fuel, groceries and bottle shop) and the Lawrence Tavern (with a great reputation for meals and friendly atmosphere). The townships of Maclean and Grafton are within a 20-30 minute drive, plus the pristine coastal beaches of Yamba and Brooms Head are only 40 minutes away.<br/><br/>First home, last home, work/life station, home base for when you are travelling - whatever stage of life you are in there is a very good chance this property package is a great match.
