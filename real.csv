The kitchen, laundry and bathrooms are all new! The exterior has been rendered and the roof repainted. There's a new air conditioner and all the wiring was redone too.

layout, sophisticated style, tranquil river views and a 2,175sqm block, this stunning Seaham home is a modern rural retreat.<br/><br/>Built by Mavid in 2019, the home has a contemporary façade with timeless appeal, featuring white weatherboard cladding offset by timber elements and a mid-grey Colorbond roof.<br/><br/>Black aluminium window surrounds add to the modern look of the façade, with the overall colour and texture palette carried through to the rest of the home. <br/><br/>Oriented to make the most of its proximity to the William River, which lies beyond the property's rear boundary, the home features large windows and sliding glass doors that let in plenty of natural light while also perfectly framing the tranquil water views.<br/><br/>The home's elevated design enhances the riverside outlook, while a rural farm gate wide enough for a car and trailer provides access to the nature reserve that lies between the property and the river.<br/><br/>While its rural aspect provides a major drawcard, the home itself is also a show-stopping attraction with its sleek styling, quality finishes and generously-proportioned design.<br/><br/>Perfect for large families, the home features four oversized bedrooms, spacious open plan living areas and an additional media room that can be closed off with double timber cavity sliding doors for added privacy.<br/><br/>The bedrooms are all generously-proportioned and well-appointed with plush dark grey carpet, roll-down UV filtered blockout blinds, LED downlights and large built-in wardrobes.<br/><br/>Located at the opposite end of the house to the children's bedrooms, the master suite offers a luxurious parents' retreat with a spacious layout and large wardrobe concealed behind the bedhead wall. <br/><br/>An opulent hotel-quality ensuite completes the picture, with marble-look floor-to-ceiling tiles, a large shower recess with twin matte black shower heads, and a custom vanity with double countertop basins, matching matte black tapware and beautiful 20mm stone benchtops with waterfall ends.<br/><br/>The main bathroom has been similarly styled for a sleek, streamlined finish, with the same matte black fittings, feature herringbone tiled wall niche in the shower and a separate bath in tiled surrounds.<br/><br/>An abundance of linen cupboards located outside the main bathroom and the well-appointed laundry provide more than enough space for all your storage needs, while a third toilet off the laundry is a practical addition.<br/><br/>A vast living room at the heart of the home accentuates the spaciousness of the layout, with double glass sliding doors framing a picturesque rural landscape and thick stand of established trees.<br/><br/>The doors can be opened up to extend your living space outside onto the wide covered alfresco area and timber deck, which runs along the rear of the home.<br/><br/>Featuring a timber post and wire balustrade that adds to the character, this area is perfect for year-round entertaining with a gas connection for a barbecue or patio heater and stunning views over the river.<br/><br/>Timber stairs at one end of the deck provide access to the long stretch of lawn that runs down to the rear fence, providing plenty for space for children to play or options for those who want to add a future swimming pool or additional garage.<br/><br/>A large window over the sink in the gourmet kitchen also provides a lovely aspect across the backyard to the river, with the white-on-white colour palette of the cabinetry and splashback tiles ensuring it does not compete with the view.<br/><br/>A lovely island bench with 40mm stone benchtop and waterfall ends offers added storage and preparation space as well as breakfast bar seating for three people, which has been cleverly oriented to enjoy the stunning scenery through the large kitchen window.<br/><br/>There is also plenty of space behind the island bench to create a more formal dining area, with the three adjoining living zones seamlessly connected with the warmth and texture of the timber-look vinyl flooring.<br/><br/>Ducted air conditioning, plantation shutters, LED downlights and square set cornices provide the finishing touches to this stunning family home, while an oversized attached double garage with dual internal access doors adds to the appeal.<br/><br/>Ideally located for those who enjoy spending their spare time on the water, with easy access to the nearby boat ramp, this magnificent property ticks all the right boxes for families looking for a rural lifestyle close to urban conveniences.<br/><br/>Seaham Public School is located directly across the road from the property and the well-stocked general store is a short walk away, while a variety of retail and commercial precincts, sporting, educational and healthcare facilities are just 15 minutes away in Raymond Terrace.<br/><br/>SMS 7Still to 0428 166 755 for a link to the online property

With completion due in 2023, the opportunity exists now to secure this prime beachfront residence.<br/><br/>Designed across 3 levels by renowned architect Mark Hurcum, this will be a residence that is both stunningly beautiful yet brilliantly functional. The Pittwater panorama is embraced and enjoyed, reaffirming the connection between home and lifestyle.<br/><br/>The floorplan is fabulous, offering as much flexibility of use as you could need. You drive into the double garage complete with workshop area on the upper level and views across the water. A remote car turntable in the driveway makes getting in and out a breeze. As you access the foyer you have the option to take the stairs or the lift to the main part of the home on the mid level floor. Walking out of the lift to the right you step into a vast open plan kitchen with butlers pantry, dining and living area, encompassed by a large curved balcony that almost puts you on Pittwater - views that will simply take your breath away.<br/><br/>To the left of the lift is a large rumpus room (that could be another bedroom, office or media room) and leads out to a shaded private deck. There is also a powder room, a storage room and a doorway that leads to a large open plan master bedroom. The bedroom has plenty of clothes storage in the walk-in-robe with a bespoke central storage unit. A private balcony overlooking the gardens to Pittwater and a unique ensuite with curved walls features a bath with a view to both escape and retreat from the world.<br/><br/>The lower level opens up to the left to an enclosed lounge room with large sliding doors on two sides to enable it to be used as an indoor/outdoor area. There are three more, well sized double-bedrooms all with water views and built-in-robes, two have their own ensuite bathroom and shower - the other has a separate bathroom and shower just opposite it that can be used by guests or when coming in from the beachfront and beautifully landscaped garden areas. To the far right of the stairway you'll find a large laundry room, tucked away but with very easy access to the private clothes drying area.<br/><br/>These plans have already been submitted to council and BASIX stamped and approved however there are options to amend them, including options to add a pool, spa or other amenities.

Look further south and your eyes feast on the flatlands that simply don’t cease; as you peer further to the west, again there’s nothing but the greatest spaciousness to the horizon.  This grassy knoll awaits your dream-home, or homes, a dreamy hobby farm, wellness-center or otherwise; there is a limitlessness at this location that can only be realized by standing on it.<br/><br/>Now with RU1, RU2 and 1A1 zoning, giving maximum flexibility from accommodation, eco-tourism and other wonderful opportunities (STCA), the door wide-open for your project to unfold.

With hundreds of Camphor Laurel trees banished from the hills of this most unique and incredible farm, the building site is opened up to views that were never considered possible.  One needs only an imagination and appreciation of what’s possible here to capitalize and live in a truly spectacular location.<br/><br/>It is an enjoyable drive 10km into Alstonville, a rich village where you can always get a park and a really great breakfast.
